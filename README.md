    â€¢ You should be able to send API requests (GET, POST) to interact with the Spring Boot, .Net services etc.<br>   

<b>OPTIONAL</b>
1. <b> Install Java Development Kit (JDK)</b>
  Java 11 or higher is required for building and running the Spring Boot microservices. Steps:<br>
  â€¢ Install JDK (Java 11 or higher): <br>
  â€¢ Download JDK 11+ TBD LINK: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11?er=221886
   
    â€¢ Verify Installation: <br>
    â€¢ Run java -version in the terminal to check the installed Java version.
     
    What you should verify:<br>
    â€¢ Make sure Java is installed correctly and the version is 11 or above.

2. <b>Install Maven</b><br>
   â€¢	Download and Install Maven<br>
      Go to the official Maven website: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi<br>
      Download the binary ZIP (not the source).<br>
      Extract it to a location like C:\maven<br>

    â€¢	Add Maven to System PATH <br>
      Now, add Maven to the Windows environment variable<br>
      Open Environment Variables:<br>
      o	Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter.<br>
      o	Go to the Advanced tab and click Environment Variables.<br>

    â€¢ Add MAVEN_HOME:<br>
      o	Under System Variables, click New.<br>
      o	Variable Name: MAVEN_HOME<br>
      o	Variable Value: C:\maven (or wherever you extracted Maven)<br>
      o	Click OK.<br>

    â€¢ Add Maven to PATH:<br>
      o	Find the Path variable under System Variables, and click Edit.<br>
      o	Click New and add: makefile Copy code C:\maven\bin<br>
