  â€¢ Verify installation by running docker --version and docker-compose --version in your terminal/command prompt.

    What you should verify:<br>
    â€¢ Run docker version and docker-compose version to ensure both are installed correctly <br>
    â€¢ Make sure Docker is running (check the Docker icon in the system tray for Windows)

2. <b> Install Java Development Kit (JDK)</b>
  Java 11 or higher is required for building and running the Spring Boot microservices. Steps:<br>
  â€¢ Install JDK (Java 11 or higher): <br>

      Open Environment Variables:<br>
      o	Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, and hit Enter.<br>
      o	Go to the Advanced tab and click Environment Variables.<br>

    â€¢ Add MAVEN_HOME:<br>
      o	Under System Variables, click New.<br>
      o	Variable Name: MAVEN_HOME<br>
      o	Variable Value: C:\maven (or wherever you extracted Maven)<br>
      o	Click OK.<br>

    â€¢ Add Maven to PATH:<br>
      o	Find the Path variable under System Variables, and click Edit.<br>
      o	Click New and add: makefile Copy code C:\maven\bin<br>
      o	Click OK to save.<br>
